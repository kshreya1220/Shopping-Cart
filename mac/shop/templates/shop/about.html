            <p>My Awesome Cart Private Limited is an Indian e-commerce company, headquartered in Bangalore, and incorporated in Singapore as a private limited company. The company initially focused on online book sales before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials, groceries, and lifestyle products.[5][6]

The service competes primarily with Amazon India and domestic rival Snapdeal.[7][8] As of FY23, Flipkart held a 48% market share in the Indian e-commerce industry.[9] Flipkart has a dominant position in the apparel segment, bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra, and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.[10] </p>
